# TDD Implementation Plan

Create detailed Test-Driven Development implementation plans through an interactive, iterative process. Follow TDD principles: Red-Green-Refactor cycles, behavior-first thinking, and incremental development.

## Initial Response

**If parameters provided:**
- Read all mentioned files FULLY (no partial reads)
- Begin research immediately

**If no parameters:**
```
I'll help you create a detailed TDD implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.

Please provide:
1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)
2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements
3. Links to related research or previous implementations

I'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive TDD plan that breaks the work into the smallest testable behaviors.

Tip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_tdd_plan thoughts/maceo/tickets/eng_1234.md`
```

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Context Gathering

1. **Read all mentioned files FULLY** (tickets, research docs, plans, JSON files)
   - Use Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset
   - DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading files yourself
   - NEVER read files partially

2. **Spawn parallel research tasks**:
   - **codebase-locator** - Find related files, configs, tests
   - **codebase-analyzer** - Understand current implementation
   - **thoughts-locator** - Find existing thoughts documents
   - **linear-ticket-reader** - Get ticket details if mentioned

3. **Read all files identified by research tasks** FULLY

4. **Present understanding with TDD focus**:
   ```
   Based on the ticket and my research, I understand we need to [summary].

   I've found:
   - [Implementation detail with file:line]
   - [Pattern/constraint discovered]

   From a TDD perspective, testable behaviors:
   - [Observable behavior 1]
   - [Observable behavior 2]

   Questions:
   - [Only ask what code investigation couldn't answer]
   ```

### Step 2: Behavior Identification

1. **If user corrects understanding**: Verify with new research tasks, don't just accept

2. **Create research todo list** using TodoWrite

3. **Identify testable behaviors**:
   - Break into **smallest observable behaviors**
   - Use "Given X, when Y, then Z" format
   - Focus on **what** not **how**
   - Identify inputs/outputs and edge cases

4. **Spawn parallel research** for test patterns, similar features, testing frameworks

5. **Present behavior breakdown**:
   ```
   **Smallest Testable Behaviors:**
   1. [Behavior] - Given [context], when [action], then [result]
   2. [Behavior] - Given [context], when [action], then [result]

   **Test Strategy:**
   - Unit tests: [behaviors]
   - Integration tests: [behaviors]
   - E2E tests: [behaviors]

   **Test Framework:** [identified from codebase]
   **Order:** Start with [simplest], then [next], finally [most complex]

   Does this breakdown make sense?
   ```

### Step 3: Plan Structure

Get feedback on structure before writing details:
```
**TDD Plan Structure:**
- Overview
- Testable Behaviors: [list]
- Each behavior follows Red-Green-Refactor:
  🔴 Red: Write failing test
  🟢 Green: Write minimal code to pass
  🔵 Refactor: Improve code while keeping tests green
```

### Step 4: Write Plan

1. **Write to**: `thoughts/searchable/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-tdd-description.md`
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-tdd-description.md`
   - Examples: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-tdd-parent-child-tracking.md`

2. **Use template structure**:

````markdown
# [Feature/Task Name] TDD Implementation Plan

## Overview
[Brief description with emphasis on testable behaviors]

## Current State Analysis
[What exists, what's missing, constraints]

### Key Discoveries:
- [Finding with file:line]
- [Pattern to follow]
- [Existing test patterns]

## Desired End State
[Specification and how to verify through tests]

### Observable Behaviors:
- [Behavior 1: Given X, when Y, then Z]
- [Behavior 2: Given X, when Y, then Z]

## What We're NOT Doing
[Out-of-scope items]

## Testing Strategy
- **Framework**: [Jest, Vitest, Rust, etc.]
- **Test Types**: Unit [what], Integration [what], E2E [what]
- **Mocking/Setup**: [strategy]

## Behavior 1: [Name]

### Test Specification
**Given**: [Initial state]
**When**: [Action]
**Then**: [Expected result]

**Edge Cases**: [list]

### TDD Cycle

#### 🔴 Red: Write Failing Test
**File**: `path/to/test/file.test.ts`
```[language]
describe('[Behavior]', () => {
  it('should [expected]', () => {
    // Arrange, Act, Assert
  });
});
```

#### 🟢 Green: Minimal Implementation
**File**: `path/to/impl/file.ts`
```[language]
// Minimal code to pass
```

#### 🔵 Refactor: Improve Code
**File**: `path/to/impl/file.ts`
```[language]
// Refactored code
```

### Success Criteria
**Automated:**
- [ ] Test fails for right reason (Red): `npm test -- file.test.ts`
- [ ] Test passes (Green): `npm test -- file.test.ts`
- [ ] All tests pass after refactor: `npm test`
- [ ] Coverage, typecheck, lint pass

**Manual:**
- [ ] Behavior works as expected
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] No regressions

## Behavior 2: [Name]
[Similar structure...]

## Integration & E2E Testing
- Integration: [scenarios]
- E2E: [user flows]

### Step 4.5: Beads Issue Tracking (Recommended)

After writing the plan file:

1. **Check for existing beads issues**:
   - Run `bd list --status=open` to see if there's already a tracked issue for this work
   - If an existing issue matches, note its ID for linking

2. **Create or update beads issue**:
   - If no existing issue: `bd create --title="[Feature Name]" --type=feature --priority=2`
   - If issue exists: `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`

3. **Add plan reference to beads issue**:
   - Include the plan path in the issue description
   - This creates traceability between TDD plans and tracked work

4. **Link dependencies if applicable**:
   - If this work depends on other issues: `bd dep add <this-issue> <depends-on>`
   - If other work depends on this: `bd dep add <other-issue> <this-issue>`

### Step 5: Sync and Review

1. **Sync**: Run `silmari-oracle sync`

2. **Present plan location** and ask for review:
   - Behaviors broken down properly?
   - Test specs clear (Given/When/Then)?
   - Red-Green-Refactor cycle clear?
   - Missing behaviors/edge cases?

3. **Iterate** based on feedback, sync after changes

## Guidelines

### Core Principles
- **Think behavior, not functions**: "How do I observe this working?" "What inputs/outputs prove it?"
- **Tiniest slice**: When stuck, go smaller (e.g., "returns empty list" → "parses single token" → "parses multiple")
- **Test fails first**: See test fail for right reason before writing code
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Each behavior must follow this cycle
- **Test first**: Always write test before implementation

### Behavior Breakdown
1. **Start simplest**: Empty input → empty output, single item, happy path
2. **Add complexity**: Multiple items, edge cases, errors
3. **Given/When/Then**: Initial state → Action → Expected result
4. **Focus observability**: What can we test? Inputs? Outputs? Side effects?
5. **Avoid implementation**: Test "what" not "how"

### Success Criteria Format
**Always separate:**
- **Automated Verification**: Commands (`make test`, `npm run lint`), test files, compilation, Red/Green/Refactor verification
- **Manual Verification**: UI/UX, performance, hard-to-automate edge cases, behavior observation

### Research Best Practices
- Spawn multiple tasks in parallel
- Be specific about directories (e.g., `silmari-oracle-wui/` not "UI")
- Request file:line references
- Wait for all tasks before synthesizing
- Verify results, don't accept incorrect findings
- Focus on test patterns and existing test files

### Common Patterns
- **New Features**: Simplest behavior → failing test → minimal code → refactor → next behavior
- **Database**: Schema tests → store unit tests → business logic integration → API E2E
- **UI Components**: Behavior tests, user interactions, edge cases, accessibility
- **Refactoring**: Ensure coverage first, refactor incrementally, run tests after each change

### Important Rules
- Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning
- Use `make` commands when possible: `make -C silmari-oracle-wui check`
- No open questions in final plan - resolve before finalizing
- Be interactive: get buy-in at each step, don't write full plan in one shot
- Be skeptical: question vague requirements, verify with code
