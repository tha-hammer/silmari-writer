# Review Plan

You are tasked with reviewing an implementation plan BEFORE implementation begins to ensure all contracts, interfaces, promises, data models, and APIs are properly defined and validated.

## Purpose

`review_plan` is a **pre-implementation architectural review** that catches design gaps before code is written. This prevents costly rework and ensures implementation success.

## Initial Setup

When invoked:

1. **Locate the plan**:
   - If plan path provided as parameter, use it
   - Otherwise, search `thoughts/searchable/shared/plans/` for recent plans
   - Ask user to specify if multiple candidates exist

2. **Read the plan completely**:
   - Use Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset
   - Understand the full scope before analysis

3. **Gather codebase context**:
   - Spawn parallel research tasks to understand existing patterns
   - Find related interfaces, contracts, and data models in the codebase

## Review Process

### Step 1: Contract Analysis

**Contracts define agreements between components.** Review for:

1. **Component Boundaries**:
   - Are boundaries between modules/services clearly defined?
   - What data crosses each boundary?
   - Who owns what state?

2. **Explicit Contracts**:
   - Are input/output contracts specified for each function/method?
   - Are preconditions and postconditions documented?
   - Are invariants maintained?

3. **Error Contracts**:
   - What errors can each component return?
   - How should callers handle each error type?
   - Are error codes/types explicitly enumerated?

4. **Spawn contract research**:
   ```
   Task: Find existing contract patterns in codebase
   - Look for trait definitions, interfaces, type signatures
   - Identify how errors are propagated
   - Note any contract enforcement patterns (assertions, validators)
   ```

### Step 2: Interface Analysis

**Interfaces define how components communicate.** Review for:

1. **Public Interface Completeness**:
   - Are all public methods/functions defined?
   - Are method signatures complete (parameters, return types)?
   - Are visibility modifiers appropriate (pub, pub(crate), private)?

2. **Interface Consistency**:
   - Do similar operations have consistent signatures?
   - Are naming conventions followed?
   - Does the interface match existing codebase patterns?

3. **Interface Evolution**:
   - Can the interface evolve without breaking changes?
   - Are extension points provided?
   - Is there a versioning strategy?

4. **Spawn interface research**:
   ```
   Task: Analyze existing interfaces in related modules
   - Find similar interfaces to model after
   - Identify trait patterns used in the codebase
   - Note any interface conventions or standards
   ```

### Step 3: Promise Analysis

**Promises define guarantees and async behavior.** Review for:

1. **Behavioral Promises**:
   - What guarantees does each component make?
   - Are idempotency guarantees specified where needed?
   - Are ordering guarantees documented?

2. **Async/Concurrent Promises**:
   - Are async operations clearly identified?
   - What happens on timeout/cancellation?
   - Are race conditions addressed?

3. **Resource Promises**:
   - Are resource cleanup guarantees specified?
   - Are memory/performance bounds documented?
   - Are RAII patterns or cleanup handlers planned?

4. **Spawn promise research**:
   ```
   Task: Find async patterns and guarantees in codebase
   - Look for async/await usage patterns
   - Identify cancellation handling
   - Note resource management patterns
   ```

### Step 4: Data Model Analysis

**Data models define the structure of information.** Review for:

1. **Schema Completeness**:
   - Are all fields defined with types?
   - Are optional vs required fields clear?
   - Are default values specified?

2. **Schema Consistency**:
   - Do field names follow conventions?
   - Are types consistent across related models?
   - Are enums/variants exhaustively defined?

3. **Data Relationships**:
   - Are relationships between models clear (1:1, 1:N, N:M)?
   - Are foreign key/reference semantics defined?
   - Are cascading behaviors specified (delete, update)?

4. **Data Evolution**:
   - Is migration strategy defined for schema changes?
   - Are backward compatibility concerns addressed?
   - Is serialization format specified?

5. **Spawn data model research**:
   ```
   Task: Analyze existing data models
   - Find similar models to compare against
   - Identify serialization patterns (serde, protobuf, etc.)
   - Note any ORM or database patterns used
   ```

### Step 5: API Analysis

**APIs define external communication contracts.** Review for:

1. **API Specification**:
   - Are all endpoints/methods defined?
   - Are request/response formats specified?
   - Are status codes/error responses documented?

2. **API Consistency**:
   - Do endpoints follow REST/RPC conventions?
   - Are naming patterns consistent?
   - Is authentication/authorization addressed?

3. **API Versioning**:
   - Is versioning strategy defined?
   - Are deprecation policies clear?
   - Are breaking changes identified?

4. **API Documentation**:
   - Are examples provided?
   - Are edge cases documented?
   - Are rate limits/quotas specified?

5. **Spawn API research**:
   ```
   Task: Analyze existing API patterns
   - Find similar endpoints to model after
   - Identify authentication patterns
   - Note error response formats used
   ```

2. **Be Specific**: Point to exact sections that need changes
3. **Be Constructive**: Provide recommendations, not just criticisms
4. **Be Practical**: Focus on issues that will cause real problems
5. **Be Pattern-Aware**: Compare against existing codebase patterns

## Severity Levels

- ✅ **Well-Defined**: No action needed
- ⚠️ **Warning**: Should be addressed, but not blocking

After completing review:
1. **Create tracking issue** if critical issues found: `bd create --title="Plan Review: [Plan Name]" --type=task --priority=1`
2. **Link issues**: If plan amendments create new work items, create and link them with `bd dep add`
3. **Update existing issue**: If reviewing a plan for an existing issue, add review findings as notes
4. **Sync beads**: Run `bd sync` to persist any beads changes
